# Insertion Sort in Assembly MIPS

### Comp303 - Computer Architecture - Microprocessor Based Assignment
This is the assignment that was given in the Computer Architecture class.

We were asked to implement a program in Assembly (specifically in MIPS), which takes integers as inputs (up to 100 numbers), sorts them using Insertion Sort, removes duplicates and finally printing the sum of the remaining elements.

More details can be learned with attached assignment report, description and comments in the code itself.
